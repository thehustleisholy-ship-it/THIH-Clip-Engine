# App Guide

This guide explains the visible parts of THIH Clip Engine and the main user flows.

## Product Summary

THIH Clip Engine turns long-form videos into short clips. Users can:

- Submit a YouTube URL
- Upload a video file
- Customize subtitles and styling
- Track processing progress in real time
- Review and edit generated clips
- Download clips for publishing

Depending on configuration, users may also see hosted billing, usage limits, or admin tooling.

## Main Screens

### Home: `/`

The homepage is the main task creation screen.

Core behaviors:

- Accepts either a YouTube URL or an uploaded file
- Shows a YouTube thumbnail preview when the URL can be parsed
- Lets users set clip styling defaults before submission
- Starts the job and transitions the user into task tracking

Available creation options on this screen include:

- Source type
  - YouTube
  - Upload
- Font family
- Font size
- Font color
- Caption template
- Include B-roll
- Output format
  - `vertical`
  - `original`
- Subtitle toggle

Additional behavior:

- Loads available fonts from the backend
- Loads caption templates from the backend
- Checks whether B-roll is configured
- Loads the latest task for the signed-in user
- Loads billing summary when monetization is enabled

If landing-only mode is enabled, the homepage can act more like a marketing shell than the full product workspace.

### Task List: `/list`

The task list is the user’s history and control center.

Users can:

- View all tasks
- See status at a glance
- Select multiple tasks
- Cancel active tasks
- Resume errored or cancelled tasks
- Delete tasks in bulk

Status states used across the UI include:

- `queued`
- `processing`
- `completed`
- `error`
- `cancelled`

### Task Detail: `/tasks/[id]`

This is the main post-submission workspace.

When a task is still running:

- The page connects to Server-Sent Events on `GET /tasks/{id}/progress`
- Progress updates appear in real time
- The page refreshes when processing completes

When a task is completed:

- Generated clips are displayed
- Users can preview videos
- Virality scores and reasoning are visible
- Users can edit, split, merge, regenerate, and export clips

Editing actions exposed in the UI map to backend operations:

- Rename or update task metadata
- Delete a clip
- Trim a clip
- Split a clip at a chosen timestamp
- Merge selected clips
- Update captions
- Regenerate a clip
- Apply project-wide style settings to a task
- Export with a platform preset such as TikTok

### Settings: `/settings`

The settings page stores user defaults and exposes billing actions when monetization is enabled.

Users can:

- Set default font family
- Set default font size
- Set default font color
- Open checkout or billing portal flows
- Sign out

The page also loads billing summary data so the user can see plan and usage information.

### Auth Screens

- `/sign-in`
- `/sign-up`

THIH Clip Engine uses Better Auth with an email and password flow backed by PostgreSQL through Prisma.

If `DISABLE_SIGN_UP=true`, sign-up is disabled for new users.

### Admin Dashboard: `/admin`

The admin area is available to users with `is_admin=true`.

It includes:

- User counts and platform metrics
- Active task visibility
- Recent generations
- Per-user generation stats
- Admin status toggles for users
- YouTube auth management tools

### Feedback

The app includes feedback submission plumbing via frontend API routes and backend handling. This can be wired to Discord webhooks when configured.

## Core User Workflows

### 1. Create a task

1. Sign in.
2. Open `/`.
3. Choose YouTube or upload mode.
4. Configure caption and styling preferences.
5. Submit the task.

The frontend sends the request through its authenticated API routes, and the backend creates a task record plus a queued background job.

### 2. Monitor progress

1. Open the task page.
2. Watch live progress from the backend SSE stream.
3. Wait for the status to move from `queued` to `processing` to `completed`.

### 3. Review clips

Once completed, the task page shows:

- Clip duration
- Transcript excerpt
- AI reasoning
- Virality scoring
- Video preview and download access

### 4. Edit clips

Users can refine clips after generation:

- Trim start or end offsets
- Split long clips into smaller ones
- Merge multiple clips
- Rewrite captions
- Reapply task-wide subtitle styling
- Export platform-specific versions

### 5. Manage billing

If monetization is enabled:

- Free and paid-plan limits can affect whether task creation is allowed
- The homepage and settings page surface billing state
- Users can open checkout or the customer portal from the frontend

## Supported Inputs

### YouTube

The app can accept standard YouTube URLs, including:

- `youtube.com/watch?v=...`
- `youtu.be/...`
- Embed-style YouTube links

The system attempts to extract the video ID on the frontend for previews and on the backend for downloading.

### File upload

Users can upload local video files through the frontend upload API. The backend stores the upload in the temporary working area before processing.

## Customization Features

### Fonts

Available fonts come from backend-managed files. The frontend fetches the list from `/api/fonts`.

Custom font upload is also supported through the media API. In monetized setups, access rules may differ from self-host mode.

### Caption templates

Caption templates are exposed by the backend and loaded into the frontend task creation and editing flows.

### B-roll

B-roll is optional and depends on `PEXELS_API_KEY`. The frontend checks whether it is available before presenting it as a real option.

### Output format

The home screen exposes at least:

- Vertical output
- Original-aspect output

The rendering path then uses backend processing rules to produce the final clip file.

## Hosted Versus Self-Hosted Behavior

### Self-host mode

When `SELF_HOST=true`:

- Monetization is disabled
- Billing-related friction is minimized
- The app behaves like an open-source self-hosted tool

### Hosted mode

When `SELF_HOST=false`:

- Billing summary endpoints matter
- Usage limits can block new task creation
- Stripe checkout and portal flows are active
- Subscription emails can be sent via Resend

## User Roles

### Standard user

Can:

- Sign in
- Create and manage their own tasks
- Edit and export their own clips
- Save personal style defaults

### Admin user

Can also:

- Access `/admin`
- Promote or demote admin status for other users
- Monitor global task activity

## Practical Support Notes

If a user says:

- "My clips never show up"
  - Check worker health, Redis, and task status
- "I can’t see my fonts"
  - Check `/api/fonts`, mounted font files, and auth mode
- "I can’t create new tasks"
  - Check billing summary, plan limits, and API keys
